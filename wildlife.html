            <p>When you are out in the backcountry, you are much more likely to come into contact with wildlife. While this can be super cool, there are some things you need to know in order to not 
                disturb the ecosystem. The most important thing is to secure your food at night, especially when you are in an area with bears. The best way to do this is with bear canisters, but in some locations you can also do this with bear bags, 
                hanging your food high up in a tree.<br>
            </p>
            <p>People tend to be the most scared of large animals, but in fact, it is rodents and such that you need to watch out for the most. Squirrels, mice, marmots, and other similar animals are much more likely than bears to get into your stuff and cause damage. 
                To combat this, don't leave things lying around the camp unattended, and if you plan to leave gear outside at night, put it in your pack first to make it harder to access.<br>
            </p>
            <p>If you do encounter a bear, you should make noise to deter it from your camp. Blowing a whistle, yelling, or banging things together will make your campsite an undesirable location for the bear, and it will go somewhere else. 
                Similar strategies will work for other large animals you might encounter, such as coyotes or mountain lions. With mountain lions, it is also helpful to make yourself look as big and intimidating as possible. In general, you don't want to 
                run away from these types of animals, as that makes you seem more like prey. The goal is instead to seem like something that is not worth their effort to deal with.<br>
            </p>
            <p>Do not under any circumstances give food to the wildlife. Human food is not good for their digestion, and it encourages them to approach people more in the future, leading to things like super aggressive squirrels. 
                Taking photos of the wildlife is a great way to document your trip, but make sure not to get too close. Animals like deer can be easily startled, and become more dangerous when they are afraid.
