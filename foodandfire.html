        <p>When packing food for a backpacking trip, the goal is to bring food with a high caloric density, meaning it will not take up a lot of space in your pack, but will still be filling. 
           The easiest food to bring is pre-made, dehydrated meals. You can buy these in any outdoor store, or create them yourself using something like couscous. These meals are super easy to 
           prepare, only requiring boiling water. For these types of meals, a stove such as a jetboil, which is designed to boil water very quickly, is an excellent choice. If you plan on doing more cooking, 
           there are backpacking stoves that act as regular stove burners. These stoves use white gas, which has the added bonus of not freezing, and the canisters are refillable.<br></p>
        <p>If you plan to have a campfire in the backcountry, you must first check the fire restrictions at your destination to ensure that they are allowed. Some places that are at a higher fire risk will prohibit campfires for part or all of the year. 
            Once you have determined that fires are allowed, you must then aquire a fire permit. These are pretty straightforward to get, but you do have to watch a video on fire safety first. Once you get to the point of actually building a fire, 
            it is important to minimaze your impact on your surroundings. </p>
            <p>If there is an existing fire circle, you should build your fire within that. If not, find a spot with minimal undergrowth away from low-hanging branches, and create one. Surround your 
            fire circle with rocks, but make sure not to get the rocks from a rier or stream because the water stays inside the rocks for a long time, and can cause them to explode. Do not cut down branches, instead using dead wood that you find on the ground. 
            When you are done with your fire, extinguish it completely, and spread out the rocks and ashes before leaving camp.
