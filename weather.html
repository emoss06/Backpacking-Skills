            <p>The weather in the mountains is a lot more volatile than the weather in other locations. The way that mountain ranges trap moisture can cause a 
                bright, sunny day to become a torrential thunderstorm in the matter of a few minutes. This change in the weather generally brings with it a drop in temperature that can be as great as 30 or more degrees. 
            </p>
            <p>Because of this phenomenon, it is important to pack for all kinds of weather, even if you are expecting only sunshine. You should always bring with you a warm jacket (down is great because it packs very small), and rain gear. 
                A big poncho that covers both you and your pack is very easy, otherwise a raincoat and a pack cover work great. Pay the most attention to the weather in the early afternoon, as this is when most unexpected storms tend to occur.

            </p>
            <p>Be careful not to enter exposed areas or lakes during thunderstorms, or when there is the threat of one. Lightning is very dangerous, and when you are exposed you are a lot more likely to get struck. 
                The safest place to be during a thunderstorm is a building or car, but in the backcountry, those are not available. Instead, ensure you are not the tallest thing around, and stay away from whatever is. 
                Crouch with only your feet touching the ground, ideally near a large boulder. Do not be afraid to turn back if the weather gets bad, staying safe is the most important thing.
