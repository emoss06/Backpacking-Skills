        <h2>These 10 things are essential to have on you at all times.</h2>
        <div id="content"><h3><ol>
            <li>Navigation - This means a map of the area and a compass.</li>
            <li>Lighting - A headlamp is the best, as it doesn't require use of your hands.</li>
            <li>Sun Protection - This includes suncreen, a hat, and sunglasses.</li>
            <li>First Aid - A first aid kit should include at the very least bandaids, antibiotic oitnment, gauze, burn cream, hydrocortizone for bug bites, antiseptic wipes, moleskin, and scissors</li>
            <li>Repair Kit - A simple repair kit includes duct tape and a knife.</li>
            <li>Fire - This includes waterproof matches and some form of tinder.</li>
            <li>Shelter - The best shelter to carry with you is an emergency blanket. They are super small, but can really save you if you get into trouble.</li>
            <li>Extra Food - You should always have at least some snacks on you, and for the trip you should pack one extra day of food per person.</li>
            <li>Extra Water - This is pretty self-explanatory, but don't let yourself get too low on water, and make sure you check that the creeks in your area are flowing.</li>
            <li>Extra Clothes - Having an extra warm layer and rain gear can save you if the weather changes unexpectedly.</li>
        </ol>
