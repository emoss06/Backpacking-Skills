            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p> Backpacking is one of the most incredible ways to experience nature. Getting away from the hustle and bustle
                of city life, including roads and cars, leads to the fullest immersion in natural life that one can possibly experience.
                Additionally, the feeling of self-reliance that comes from carrying all your gear on your back creates a sense of self
                that is confident and in control. However, this feeling of self-reliance can also seem quite intimidating.<br>
            </p>
            <p> That's why it is important to educate youself on the ins and outs of backpacking before planning a trip. 
                Once you know what you are getting into and are adequately prepared, then you will be best able to enjoy your
                outdoor adventure.<br>
            </p>
            <p> In this guide, you will find a brief overview of information that covers all the key things you need to know 
                about backpacking. This guide is perfect for people with no backpacking experience looking to explore the activity,
                beginners looking for more information and ways to improve their experience, and anybody else who wants to learn or
                refresh some outdoor skills.<br>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> 
                My name is Eleanor and I have been a Girl Scout for 12 years and a backpacker for three. I have done numerous skill trainings for younger Girl Scouts, and I am well-versed in the world of backpacking. 
                Backpacking is my passion, and I hope that this guide can encourage more people to feel confident giving it a try.
